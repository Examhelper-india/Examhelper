      <h2>French Revolution (1789‚Äì1799)</h2>
      <p>The French Revolution was a period of radical social and political change in France. It began in 1789 due to financial crisis, inequality, and demand for rights. 
      The monarchy under Louis XVI faced opposition as people demanded liberty, equality, and fraternity. The storming of the Bastille marked its beginning. 
      It abolished feudalism, spread democratic ideals, and inspired revolutions worldwide. Leaders like Robespierre played key roles, though the Reign of Terror also brought violence. 
      Finally, it paved the way for Napoleon Bonaparte‚Äôs rise.</p>
